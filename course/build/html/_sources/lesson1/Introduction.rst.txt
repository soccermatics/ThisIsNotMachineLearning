Let's start the story where I started my book, with a visit from two 
soon-to-be professional gamblers...

Marius and Jan wanted to learn about using equations in professional gambling. 
For my part, I wanted to learn how they worked and how they thought. I was also eager
to try out an equation 
`proposed <http://www.on-my-radar-screen.com/files/1994-benter.pdf>`_ by one of the most successful professional 
gamblers of all time, William Benter.

In Chapter 1 of the Ten Equations, you can read more about 
how Benter made a billion dollars; how British gamblers, Matthew Benham and Tony Bloom  
followed a similar approach to football, allowing them to buy their childhood clubs 
Brentford and Brighton, respectively; and I meet Oxford statistician Sir David Cox who discovered the maths behind their approaches.

Now we will look in more detail at the equation that 
Marius, Jan and I used to make money on the 2018 Wrold Cup: The Betting 
Equation.

We are going to start by learning the basics of
:ref:`odds and probabilities<oddsandprobs>`. Then, in section :ref:`fitmodel`, 
we will learn how
to load bookmakers odds in to Python and 
use the equation above to find a bias in the odds. Finally,
we will look at the prediction the model makes 
for :ref:`the World Cup 2022<predictions2022>`.
