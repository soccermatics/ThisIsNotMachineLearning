This is the companion website to David Sumpter's book 
`The Ten Equations that Rule The World <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Equations-that-Rule-World/dp/0141991097>`_. 

In these pages, I go deep in to the maths and programming used in the book. 
I show step by step how to find edges over bookmakers; 
the logic of Bayesian reasoning; the inner workings of the 
algorithms used by Google, Facebook and Youtube work; how mathematicians
model the financial world; and many other mathematical secrets.

*This is currently work in progress.* Chapter 1 on The Betting Equation is complete.
Stay tuned over Winter 2022 to Spring 2023 as I add more content. 

**To get the most out of this site please read the book.**
