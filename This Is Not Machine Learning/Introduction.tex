\section{This is not...}

While most courses in machine learning and mathematical modelling cover the details of how the methods illustrated above work, our overall purpose is different. {\it This is not a course in machine learning.} It is a rather a course in how to approach the complex reality of the world with machine learning and mathematical modelling tools.

We are going to learn how to position the use of models in a complex world; what we can (and can't) expect to achieve with these models; how to become aware of and describe the limitations of models; and consider situations when it might be better not to use a model at all.  

The title 'this is not' plays, like the artwork that inspires it, on the contradications and ambiguity inherent in modelling. Much of what we will discuss is not the tools of machine learning, but it is the...
